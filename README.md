Mortal Kombat Armageddon HD Texture Pack [PCSX2]

This is a HD Texture Pack created for use in MK: Armageddon [PS2] using AI Image Upscaling

  Note: This is still a Work-In-Progress and I will update it as I go
  
1) Drop Inside textures folder inside PCSX2
2) Click on PCSX2 Settings/Graphics
3) Click on Texture Replacement Window and Enable 'Load Textures' & 'Precache Textures'
4) Done!

!! Choose between U (Upscaled) or U2x (Upscaled 2x) !!

   ! Upscaled x2 is Much higher Resolution but may have some some Texture Artifacts !
   
   ^ I will fix these as I go ^
