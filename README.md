Mortal Kombat Armageddon HD Texture Pack [PCSX2]

This is a HD Texture Pack created for use in MK: Armageddon [PS2] using AI Image Upscaling

  Note: This is still a Work-In-Progress and I will update it as I go, some textures are still missing though most are done.
  
1) Extract 'SLUS-21410.rar' 
2) Drop Extracted folder inside of 'textures' folder within PCSX2
3) Click on PCSX2 Settings/Graphics
4) Click on Texture Replacement Window and Enable 'Load Textures' & 'Precache Textures'
5) Done!
