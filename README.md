Mortal Kombat Armageddon HD Texture Pack [PCSX2]

This is a HD Texture Pack created for use in MK: Armageddon [PS2] using AI Image Upscaling

  Note: This is still a Work-In-Progress and I will update it as I go, some textures are still missing though most are done.
  
1) Drop Inside textures folder inside PCSX2
2) Click on PCSX2 Settings/Graphics
3) Click on Texture Replacement Window and Enable 'Load Textures' & 'Precache Textures'
4) Done!
   
   - 1 Known Error: When loading a save, Game Display freezes but is still playing 
      (Press 'Start' and then press 'X' to get past this) - You should hear the game in response.
